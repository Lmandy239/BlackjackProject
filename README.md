Hey welcome to BlackJack!!

#Description
Simple Black Jack game between you and the PC.

BEFORE YOU START- 
The game follows standard Blackjack rules, where the goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
The player can choose to "hit" or "stand" during their turn and so can the dealer, however due to restrictions of time there is no message showing the dealers "hit" action. However, do know that if the dealer has more cards is because he kept choosing to hit instead of stand.
The reason why this wasn't changed last minute is because the dealer never starts with 2 cards, but one and a message that creates the illusion of having 2 cards, which then his logic of adding until >= 17 makes him add and then print his actual cards.
The dealer follows a set of rules for their turn, typically hitting until their hand value is 17 or higher. 

#Instructions:
To use the program, follow these simple steps:

1- Run the program as a Java application or compile it using the javac command from the terminal and then execute it.
2- Once the program opens, you can use the interactive menu to start a match.
3- Choose to Hit/Stand versus the computer. 
#Tech Used

-Classes in an Object-Oriented manner: APIE.
-Collections 
-Conditionals
-Use of methods

#Lessons Learned
The most difficult part was to pass down the methods and differentiate which classes did what. Looking back at it, a lot of my methods in main could have been part of their respective classes such as the players turn. Overall, this gave me a bit more insight as how an object oriented program works. Now, I at least know how to implement those classes methods without confusing myself. Furthermore, the game logic was a bit complicated.
